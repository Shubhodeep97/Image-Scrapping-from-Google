## Acknowledgements

 This project is a part of my internship task at Newbieron Technologies. 



## Drscription

A python script in which user can search images from 'Google' by entering a particular keyword and can download 50 images of their choice. This script will fetch the results and download them in the local system by creating a folder separately. 

I made this whole script in jupyter notebook.

To parse the html code I used BeautifulSoup.
